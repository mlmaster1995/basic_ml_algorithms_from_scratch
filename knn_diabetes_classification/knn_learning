NN features:
1. it's lazy and cosume a lot of ram;

when KNN is used:
1. data is labeled
2. data is noise free
3. data is small

Some pros and cons of KNN
Pros:

    No assumptions about data — useful, for example, for nonlinear data
    Simple algorithm — to explain and understand/interpret
    High accuracy (relatively) — it is pretty high but not competitive in comparison to better supervised learning models
    Versatile — useful for classification or regression

Cons:

    Computationally expensive — because the algorithm stores all of the training data
    High memory requirement
    Stores all (or almost all) of the training data
    Prediction stage might be slow (with big N)
    Sensitive to irrelevant features and the scale of the data3. data is small
