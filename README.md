### About The Project 
This project was conducted for the course "machine learning" during the graduate study. The project was finished
as the course was going in 2019. The included algorithms are all supervised classifiers containing KNN, 
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bays, Support Vector Machine and Ensemble Learning Methods
(such as adaBoost and hard voting). Each algorithm is written in the pure python and Scipy, NumPy, Pandas packages.
The performance of each algorithm is compared to the algorithm from the Scikit Learn package.   

### Built With 
* [Python 3.7](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### Datasets
The dataset in this project is [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and 
[Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci). Either one or the other will be used in the 
algorithm test files. 

### Usage
The project is developed by PyCharm IDE and the Supervised_ML_Algorithm_From_Scratch is 
the IDE project folder. Remaining python files are read to use.
